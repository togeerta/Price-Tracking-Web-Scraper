The book is divided into five units: Complex Variables, Laplace Transforms, Fourier Series, Partial Differential Equations, and Numerical Methods. Each unit has several chapters that cover the topics in detail. The first unit introduces the basic concepts of complex numbers, functions, and integrals, and then discusses the applications of complex variables in conformal mapping, potential theory, and fluid mechanics. The second unit explains the theory and properties of Laplace transforms, and then shows how to use them to solve ordinary differential equations, integral equations, and difference equations. The third unit covers the topics of Fourier series, Fourier integrals, and Fourier transforms, and then illustrates their applications in heat conduction, wave propagation, and signal processing. The fourth unit deals with the classification and solution of partial differential equations using various methods such as separation of variables, method of characteristics, and transform methods. The fifth unit introduces the concepts and techniques of numerical methods such as interpolation, differentiation, integration, root finding, linear algebraic equations, and ordinary differential equations.
 
Applied Mathematics IV by Prof.G.V. Kumbhojkar is a useful book for students who want to learn and master the mathematical tools that are essential for engineering analysis and design.

## How to Prepare and Perform Jummah Prayer
 
Jummah prayer is a special prayer that is only performed on Fridays. It consists of two rak'ahs (units) of prayer, followed by a khutbah (sermon) delivered by the imam (leader). The time for Jummah prayer begins when the sun passes its zenith and ends before the time for Asr prayer starts. However, it is recommended to perform Jummah prayer as early as possible.
 
To prepare and perform Jummah prayer, one should follow these steps:

1. Do ghusl (ritual bath) on Friday morning or before going to the mosque. This is a sunnah (recommended act) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that purifies the body and soul. One should also wear clean and decent clothes, apply perfume, trim the nails, brush the teeth, and comb the hair.
2. Go to the mosque early and walk if possible. This will increase the reward and virtue of Jummah prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "Whoever does ghusl then comes to Jumu`ah, and prays as much as Allah decrees for him, then listens attentively until the khutbah is over, then prays with him (the imam), will be forgiven for (his sins) between that and the next Jumu`ah and three more days."[^4^] He also said: "Whoever walks to Jumu`ah prayer, for every step he will have the reward of fasting and praying qiyam for one year."
3. Pray two rak'ahs of sunnah prayer when entering the mosque. This is a sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that shows respect to the mosque and prepares one for the main prayer. One should also avoid stepping over people or disturbing them while looking for a place.
4. Sit close to the imam and listen attentively to the khutbah. This is an obligation that must be fulfilled by every Muslim who attends Jummah prayer. The khutbah is a source of guidance, reminder, and exhortation that addresses various issues related to Islam and Muslims. One should not talk, play, or do anything that distracts from listening to the khutbah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "If you say to your companion, 'Be quiet and listen,' when the imam is delivering the khutbah, then you have engaged in idle speech."
5. Stand up and follow the imam in the two rak'ahs of Jummah prayer. This is the main part of Jummah prayer that replaces Zhuhr prayer on Fridays. The imam will recite Surah al-Fatihah and another surah from the Quran in both rak'ahs out loud. The followers will listen silently and say "Ameen" after Surah al-Fatihah. Then they will bow, prostrate, sit, and say tashahhud as usual.
6. Pray four rak'ahs of sunnah prayer after Jummah prayer. This is a sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that completes Jummah prayer. One can pray these four rak'ahs in the mosque or at home.

By preparing and performing Jummah prayer properly, one can attain great rewards and blessings from Allah. Some of these rewards are:

- One's sins are forgiven between two Jumu`ahs.
- One's faith is increased and renewed.
- One's knowledge is enhanced and updated.
- One's unity and brotherhood with other Muslims are strengthened.
- One's supplications are more likely to be answered.

Therefore, Jummah prayer is a great opportunity that Muslims should not miss or neglect. It is a weekly appointment with Allah that brings peace, mercy, and grace to the believers.

After the decline of the Vijayanagara empire in the 16th century, Tamilnadu witnessed the rise of various regional powers, such as the Nayaks, the Marathas, the Nawabs of Arcot and the Carnatic kingdom. These rulers fought among themselves and with the European powers, such as the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the British, who established trading posts and colonies along the coast. The British East India Company gradually expanded its control over most of Tamilnadu through wars, treaties and alliances. The company also faced resistance from local leaders and movements, such as Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Puli Thevar, Dheeran Chinnamalai, Vellore Mutiny and the Polygar Wars.
 
In 1858, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown took over the administration of India from the company. Tamilnadu became part of the Madras Presidency, a province of British India that covered most of south India. The presidency witnessed many social and political reforms, such as the Self-Respect Movement, the Justice Party, the Indian National Congress and the Dravidian Movement. The presidency also played a significant role in the Indian independence movement, with leaders such as C. Rajagopalachari, Subramania Bharati, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Periyar E. V. Ramasamy.

Zambezia has a variety of colorful and quirky characters that make the film more enjoyable and entertaining. The main character, Kai, is voiced by Jeremy Suarez, who is best known for his role as Jordan Thomkins on The Bernie Mac Show. Kai is a curious and adventurous falcon who wants to explore the world and find his place in it. He is brave, loyal, and optimistic, but also naive, impulsive, and rebellious.
 
Kai's love interest is Zoe, a black-winged kite who is the daughter of Chief Sekhuru, the leader of Zambezia. Zoe is voiced by Abigail Breslin, who rose to fame for her role as Olive Hoover in Little Miss Sunshine. Zoe is a spirited and independent bird who dreams of joining the Hurricanes, an elite group of fliers who protect Zambezia from threats. She is smart, confident, and compassionate, but also stubborn, prideful, and reckless.
 
One of Kai's mentors is Ajax, a fat lammergeier who is the leader of the Hurricanes. Ajax is voiced by Jeff Goldblum, who is known for his roles in Jurassic Park and Independence Day. Ajax is a wise and experienced flier who has a dry sense of humor and a sarcastic wit. He is calm, patient, and respectful, but also strict, demanding, and secretive.
 
The main antagonist of the film is Cecil, a marabou stork who leads a gang of scavengers that want to take over Zambezia. Cecil is voiced by Richard E. Grant, who has appeared in films such as Gosford Park and Logan. Cecil is a cunning and ruthless bird who holds a grudge against Zambezia for excluding his species from their community. He is manipulative, vengeful, and cruel, but also charismatic, persuasive, and resourceful.
 
Other notable characters include Tendai (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson), Kai's overprotective father and a former Hurricane; Sekhuru (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Zoe's father and the wise chief of Zambezia; Ezee (voiced by Jamal Mixon), Kai's best friend and a clumsy hornbill; Pavi (voiced by Jenifer Lewis), a sassy weaver bird who runs a beauty salon; Budzo (voiced by Jim Cummings), a giant monitor lizard who allies with Cecil; and Gogo (voiced by Noureen DeWulf) and Tini (voiced by Deep Roy), two storks who transport eggs across Africa.
